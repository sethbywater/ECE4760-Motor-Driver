Control system summary

- Get commanded position/velocity from USB/UART/CAN
- Update encoder counts, current measurement
- PID control for commanded position/velocity, clamping at a max speed, acceleration, and jerk
- Output of command PID is the input to FOC control
	- Use rotor position to obtain D and Q components (Clarke and Park)
	- Torque Q PI control input = commanded torque - Q component
	- Torque D PI control input = 0 - D component
	- Use outputs of Q and D PI controllers to obtain output voltages (Inverse Park and Clarke)
- Set output voltages obatined using FOC
